Part 1:Augmented Reality with Planar Homographies
In this assignment, you will be implementing an AR application step by step using planar
homographies. You will first learn to find point correspondences between two images and use
these to estimate the homography between them. Using this homography you will then warp
images and finally implement your own AR application.Our Final goal is to overlay each frame of ar source.mov onto the book in book.mov
